# Who are PyLadies?

An international group of people trying to involve women in the Python programming community.

## Why?

About 10-15% of programmers are women. That's very little. It's not that women are stupid or 
awkward or have no logical thinking. They are discouraged by other things; 
a lots of small details that create a not very friendly environment. 
PyLadies are trying to solve this problem, for example by creating an environment 
that is more enjoyable for new programmers.

## PyLadies in Czechia

 * 2012 - there was a Django workshop (Python framework for web pages) during the Ruby on Rails
 (another programming language) conference.
 * 2013 - The first PyLadies course (for free) in Brno -- the first course that had own 
 open-source materials
 * 2015 - this course also started in Prague
 * 2016 - PyLadies in Ostrava
 * 2018 - PyLadies in Pilsen, Hradec Kralove, and the first English (translated) version of the 
 Czech course - the first open-source materials (at least as we know) by volunteers from CA Technologies.
 
## What will you learn here?

* Basic programming: variables, data types, conditions, loops, functions, exceptions, modules, ...
* Skills connected with programming: command line, version control, collaboration, and open-source
* Games: text games and also some graphic games

## What shouldn't you expect?

* an IT course
* PyLadies do not require knowledge of advanced mathematics or graph theory. 
If you are interested in these topics, we recommend studying computer science instead of 
attending this course.
* This is also not a course like Django Girls, RailsGirls, or Czechitas that are focused on
creating web pages.
* And finally, PyLadies are not the course - PyLadies are the ones preparing the course :)

## Coaches

* We are here in our free time - volunteering
* We will help you if you have a problem
* We shouldn't touch your keyboard (so each time we try to do this, you should slap our fingers :) )
* How to contact us: Marketa.Muzikova(at)ca.com, Vsevolod.Khanin(at)ca.com, Atul.Sharma(at)ca.com,
Charalampos.Polychronakis(at)ca.com, Alexandru.Dumitru(at)ca.com 
* Join our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/pyladies.prague.english/) where you can
ask us anything. 

## Red and Green post-its

During our lessons we will use red and green post-its. When we are doing an exercise and
you finish it successfully -- stick the green paper on the right upper corner of your screen 
so everyone can see it. If however you encounter ANY problem, stick the red (pink, actually) 
post-it on your screen and someone will help you.  
* RED POST-IT: I have a problem, please help me!
* GREEN POST-IT: I have successfully finished the exercise :)

We won't continue until everyone has a green post-it on their laptop's screen.

## What to do after this course?

* You will need to practice a lot so you don't forget everything
* At this time, we can't promise anything, we want to do some workshops on advanced topics,
but as I said -- we can't promise anything
* You can also practice and learn some advanced stuff (e. g. algorithms, data structures) 
at [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)
* There are also a lot of games where you practice by "coding" a game (the beginnings are
not really hard, they will give you a foundation) - e.g. [Coding game](https://www.codingame.com/start),
[Code combat](https://codecombat.com/), [Checkio](https://checkio.org/), [Cyber Dojo](http://www.cyber-dojo.org/),
[Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/)
* Once a month there is [Pyvo](https://pyvo.cz/praha-pyvo/), some lightning talks are in English
* You can go to [PyWorking](https://pyworking.cz/), but it's mostly in Czech
* If you have a project in mind, you can go to [Meetups](https://pyworking.cz/) (right side
of the page) where surely someone speaks English
* Or you can read some books - I recommend to follow [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/) where
they once offered a bundle with books, videos, and some software for Python development, or books about how 
to develop games with Python. Currently (25.9. - 9.10.2018) there is a [bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/learn-you-some-code-books) that includes the great book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" for just €0.75, or you can find many more
books about different programming languages. You can find just the e-book "Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming" for €12.74 (on Amazon for €19.49).

And now, the coaches will introduce themselves. (Once they finish, it will be your turn, so 
think about what you want to say -- your name, why you want to learn python, ...?)

# Who are Pyladies?

An international group of people trying to involve women in the Python programming community.

## Why?

About 10-15% of programmers are women. That's very little. It's not that women are stupid or 
awkward or have no logical thinking. They are discouraged by other things; 
a lots of small details that create not very friendly environment. 
PyLadies are trying to solve this problem, for example by creating an environment 
that is more enjoyable for new programmers.

## PyLadies in Czechia

 * 2012 - there was Django workshop (Python framework for web pages) during Ruby on Rails
 (another programming language) conference.
 * 2013 - there was first PyLadies course (for free) in Brno - first course that had own 
 open-source materials
 * 2015 - this course also started in Prague
 * 2016 - PyLadies in Ostrava
 * 2018 - PyLadies in Pilsen, Hradec Kralove and first English (translated)version of 
 Czech course - first open-source materials (at least as we know) by volunteers from CA Technologies
 
## What will you learn here?

* Basic programming: variables, data types, conditions, cycles, functions, exceptions, modules, ...
* Skills connected with programming: command line, version control, collaboration and open-source
* Games: text and also some graphic games

## What you shouldn't expect?

* IT course
* PyLadies do not require the knowledge of advanced mathematics or graph theory. 
If you are interested in those topics we recommend studying computer science instead of 
attending this course.
* This is also not courses like Django Girls, RailsGirls or Czechitas that are focused on
creating web pages.
* PyLadies are also not course - PyLadies are preparing this course :)

## What to do after this course?

* You will need to practice a lot so you don't forget everything
* At this time we can't promise anything, we want to do some workshops on advanced topics
but as I said - we can't promise anything
* You can also practice and learn some advanced stuff (e. g. algorithms, data structures) 
at [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)
* There are also a lot of games where you practice by "coding" a game (the beginnings are
not really hard, they will give you some ground) - e. g. [Coding game](https://www.codingame.com/start),
[Code combat](https://codecombat.com/), [Checkio](https://checkio.org/), [Cyber Dojo](http://www.cyber-dojo.org/),
[Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/)
* Once a month there is [Pyvo](https://pyvo.cz/praha-pyvo/) where some lightning talks are in English
* You can go to [PyWorking](https://pyworking.cz/) but it's mostly in Czech
* If you have some project in mind you can go to [Meetups](https://pyworking.cz/)(right side
of the page) where surely will be someone who speaks English
* Or you can read some books - I recommend follow [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/) where
were once bundle with books, videos and some software for Python development or books about how 
to develop games with Python and currently (25.9. - 9.10.2018) there is [bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/learn-you-some-code-books)
where is great book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" for just €0.75 or you can have much more
books about different programming languages "Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming"
for €12.74 (you can find just this e-book on Amazon for €19.49)


## Coaches

* We are here in our free time - volunteering
* We will help you if you have some problem
* We shouldn't touch your keyboard (so each time we will try to do it you should slap us :) )
* How to contact us: Marketa.Muzikova(at)ca.com, Vsevolod.Khanin(at)ca.com, Atul.Sharma(at)ca.com,
Charalampos.Polychronakis(at)ca.com, Alexandru.Dumitru(at)ca.com 
* Join our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/pyladies.prague.english/) so you can
ask us anything. 

## Red and Green post-its

During our lessons we will use red and green post-its. When there will be some exercise and
you will finish it successfully - stick the green paper on the right upper corner of your screen 
so everyone can see it. If you would have ANY problem stick there the red (pink actually) 
post-it and someone will help you.  
* RED POST-IT: I have some problem, please help me!
* GREEN POST-IT: I have successfully finished the exercise :)

We won't continue until everyone has green post-it on their laptop's screen.

And now coaches will introduce themselves (once they finish it will be your turn so you can 
already think about what will you say - name, why you want to learn python, ...)
